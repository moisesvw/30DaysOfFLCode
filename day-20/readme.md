# **Day 20: Exploring Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**

## **What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)?**

In an increasingly data-driven world, privacy is paramount. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing decryption. This ensures data privacy in applications like federated learning, where data remains distributed and protected.

FHE solves a previously insurmountable problem: combining privacy and functionality by enabling complex computations without exposing sensitive data.

## **How FHE Works: Simplified**

1. **Encryption**: Data is transformed into an encrypted format.
2. **Homomorphic Operations**: Computations (e.g., addition, multiplication) are performed on encrypted data.
3. **Decryption**: Encrypted results are decrypted to reveal the final value.

For instance, instead of sending sensitive data to a server, encrypted data is sent. The server performs operations on the encrypted data and returns encrypted results, which can then be decrypted locally.

## **Practical Example: Implementing FHE with Python**

Using the **TenSEAL** library, we can see FHE in action with the following example:

### **Basic Operations with FHE**

```python
# Install TenSEAL with: pip install tenseal
import tenseal as ts

# Create an encryption context
context = ts.context(ts.SCHEME_TYPE.CKKS, poly_modulus_degree=8192, coeff_mod_bit_sizes=[60, 40, 40, 60])
context.global_scale = 2**40

# Original data
vector = [3.5, 4.2, 5.1]
print("Original data:", vector)

# Encrypt the data
encrypted_vector = ts.ckks_vector(context, vector)
print("Encrypted data:", encrypted_vector.serialize()[:50], "...")

# Perform a homomorphic operation (scalar multiplication)
encrypted_result = encrypted_vector * 2

# Decrypt the result
decrypted_result = encrypted_result.decrypt()
print("Decrypted result:", decrypted_result)
````

**Results:**

- **Original data:** `[3.5, 4.2, 5.1]`
- **Decrypted result after multiplying by 2:** `[7.0, 8.4, 10.2]`

### **Federated Learning and FHE**

In federated learning, models are trained on distributed data that remains on local devices. FHE enhances this process by encrypting gradients before sending them to the server.

**Example: Applying a learning rate to encrypted gradients**

```python
# Simulated gradient
gradient = [0.01, -0.02, 0.03]

# Encrypt the gradient
encrypted_gradient = ts.ckks_vector(context, gradient)
print("Encrypted gradient sent to the server.")

# Apply a learning rate
learning_rate = 0.1
updated_gradient = encrypted_gradient * learning_rate

# Decrypt the updated gradient
decrypted_updated_gradient = updated_gradient.decrypt()
print("Decrypted updated gradient:", decrypted_updated_gradient)
```

## **How Does FHE Address Memorization Attacks?**

FHE offers a layer of protection against the kind of **memorization attacks** explored in [Day 19](https://github.com/moisesvw/30DaysOfFLCode/tree/main/day-19), where sensitive information could be extracted from trained models.

- By ensuring that data is always encrypted, FHE minimizes the risk of raw data being inadvertently memorized during model training.
- In scenarios where language models like GPT-2 or GPT-3 are used, gradients and updates can be encrypted using FHE, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to extract meaningful information from the training process.

---

## **Practical Considerations**

While FHE provides unparalleled privacy, it comes with certain challenges:

1. **Computational Overhead**:
    - Operations on encrypted data are up to 10,000 times slower than plaintext computations.
2. **Data Size**:
    - Encrypted data is significantly larger than plaintext.
3. **Noise Management**:
    - Successive operations increase noise, which can affect accuracy.

## **Recent Advances**

1. **Hardware Accelerators**: Significant reductions in latency for FHE computations.
2. **Algorithmic Optimizations**: New schemes like BGV and CKKS have improved efficiency.

These advances make FHE increasingly practical for privacy-critical applications, such as healthcare and distributed learning.

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Privacy Preservation**: FHE allows secure computations without exposing sensitive data.
2. **Applications in Federated Learning**: Encrypting gradients ensures data remains private during collaborative model training.
3. **Protection Against Memorization Attacks**: By encrypting the training process, FHE mitigates risks of sensitive data being memorized by language models.
4. **Challenges to Overcome**: Computational costs and noise management are ongoing areas of research and improvement.

Fully Homomorphic Encryption represents a transformative step towards a secure and private future. With advancements in hardware and algorithms, it is becoming a viable option for privacy-focused computations.
