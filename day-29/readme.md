# **Day 29: Scaling LLM Fine-Tuning with Federated Learning and PEFT**

Today, I explored a critical problem in the AI landscape: how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) across distributed systems without compromising privacy or overloading computationally constrained edge devices. Inspired by the paper ["Resource-Aware Federated Fine-Tuning for LLMs"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06448), I dove into the challenges, techniques, and practical approaches to make federated learning feasible for LLMs.

## **Key Insights**

### **1. The Core Problem**

- **Privacy Constraints**: Organizations, such as hospitals, often cannot share sensitive data due to privacy concerns.
- **Computational Limits**: Edge devices hosting data typically have low-cost GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090-Ti) that cannot handle the resource demands of LLM fine-tuning, which often requires data center-grade GPUs.

### **2. The Proposed Solution**

To address these constraints, the paper introduces **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** and federated learning techniques tailored for heterogeneous devices:

- **PEFT Techniques**: Adjust only a small subset of model parameters instead of the entire model, making the process lightweight and efficient.
- **Resource-Aware Federated Learning**: Dynamically adjust the workloads for devices with varying capabilities.

---

## **Techniques Explained**

### **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**

PEFT reduces the burden of fine-tuning by focusing on a few key parameters. Key techniques include:

#### **1. Adapters**

- Small trainable layers added between existing layers of the model.
- Capture task-specific adjustments without modifying the core model.

#### **2. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

- Decomposes weight updates into low-rank matrices.
- Example: Instead of adjusting a 512x512 matrix, it trains two smaller matrices (e.g., 512x8 and 8x512).
- **Benefits**: Drastically reduces memory usage and computational load.

#### **3. Prompt Tuning**

- Fine-tunes a task-specific prompt while keeping the entire model frozen.
- Used effectively for tasks where input-specific guidance can improve performance.

### **Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Devices**

In federated learning (FL), edge devices collaboratively train a model by sharing only updates (e.g., gradients) with a central server. However, challenges arise:

#### **Challenges**

1. **Resource Disparity**: Devices with varying computational power need balanced workloads.
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Gradients can leak sensitive information.

#### **Solutions**

1. **Dynamic Workload Assignment**: Devices with more resources perform larger computations.
2. **Secure Aggregation**:
    - Encrypt gradients to ensure the server cannot access individual contributions.
3. **Differential Privacy**:
    - Add controlled noise to gradients, preventing sensitive data inference.

## **Practical Implementation**

To illustrate these concepts, I implemented a simulation combining PEFT and federated learning.

### **Pipeline with LoRA and Federated Aggregation**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Model Definitions
class BaseModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(BaseModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.freeze_parameters()

    def freeze_parameters(self):
        for param in self.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

class LoRAAdapter(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim, rank=4):
        super(LoRAAdapter, self).__init__()
        self.down = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, rank, bias=False)
        self.up = nn.Linear(rank, hidden_dim, bias=False)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.up(self.down(x))

# Federated Client
class FederatedClient:
    def __init__(self, base_model, adapter):
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.adapter = adapter
        self.optimizer = optim.SGD(self.adapter.parameters(), lr=0.01)

    def train(self, x, y, epochs=1):
        self.base_model.eval()
        for _ in range(epochs):
            self.optimizer.zero_grad()
            with torch.no_grad():
                features = self.base_model(x)
            output = self.adapter(features)
            loss = nn.MSELoss()(output, y)
            print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
            loss.backward()
            self.optimizer.step()
        return self.adapter.state_dict()

# Federated Aggregation
def federated_aggregation(updates):
    avg_update = {k: torch.mean(torch.stack([u[k] for u in updates]), dim=0) for k in updates[0].keys()}
    return avg_update

# Simulation
input_dim, hidden_dim = 10, 8
base_model = BaseModel(input_dim, hidden_dim)
clients = [FederatedClient(base_model, LoRAAdapter(hidden_dim)) for _ in range(3)]

data = [torch.randn(5, input_dim) for _ in range(3)]
labels = [torch.randn(5, hidden_dim) for _ in range(3)]

for round in range(3):
    print(f"Round {round + 1}")
    updates = [client.train(data[i], labels[i]) for i, client in enumerate(clients)]
    global_update = federated_aggregation(updates)
    print(f"Aggregated Global Update: {global_update}")
```

### **Key Features in the Code**

1. **LoRA Adapter**: Introduced to reduce parameter updates.
2. **Federated Aggregation**: Combines updates from multiple clients into a global model.
3. **Resource Adaptability**: Simulates workloads for multiple clients with varying capacities.

3. **Education**: Universities train models for student assessment without centralizing academic records.
