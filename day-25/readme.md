# **Day 25: Federated Analytics Without Data Collection**

## **Exploring Federated Analytics with Google Research**

Today, I delved into the **Google Research blog post**:  
[**Federated Analytics: Collaborative Data Science without Data Collection**](https://research.google/blog/federated-analytics-collaborative-data-science-without-data-collection/).  
The post introduces innovative techniques that blend **Federated Learning (FL)** and **privacy-enhancing methods** to enable collaborative data analysis without centralizing sensitive information.

### **Key Learnings**

#### **1. Federated Analytics Overview**

Federated Analytics extends the principles of FL by focusing on **data analysis** rather than training predictive models. The key idea is to allow distributed devices to collaboratively compute global insights while keeping individual data local.

#### **2. Techniques Involved**

- **Federated Learning:**  
    FL enables decentralized model training, sending only model updates (not raw data) to a central server for aggregation. Federated Analytics adopts similar principles for data analysis.
    
- **Differential Privacy:**  
    Noise is added to local or aggregated data, ensuring that individual contributions cannot be inferred even if additional external information is available.
    
- **Secure Aggregation:**  
    A cryptographic technique that enables the server to compute the sum of encrypted inputs without accessing individual values.

### **Real-World Applications**

#### **1. Speech Recognition Enhancement:**

- Improve voice models using distributed data. For example, updates to **"Now Playing"** features (like recognizing popular songs) are aggregated securely.

#### **2. Federated Heavy Hitters Discovery (Gboard Use Case):**

- Identify frequently typed new words without accessing raw keystrokes, ensuring privacy while improving autocorrect and prediction models.

### **Challenges Without Federated Analytics**

1. **Privacy Risks:**  
    Transferring raw data to a central server increases the risk of leaks or unauthorized access.
    
2. **Compliance Issues:**  
    Laws like GDPR and CCPA require strict adherence to data privacy standards.
    
3. **User Distrust:**  
    Collecting sensitive information can erode user trust in applications or platforms.
    
4. **Bias in Data Models:**  
    Lack of diversified data can lead to poor generalization in centralized systems.

## **Practical Implementation**

To bring these concepts to life, I explored a simulated implementation inspired by **Google’s "Now Playing"** and **Gboard** use cases, where local devices securely aggregate data.

---

### **Part 1: Federated Analytics Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Local Data Simulation**

Each device maintains its own set of data. For example, local song recognition counts:

```python
devices = {
    "device_1": {"song_A": 5, "song_B": 3},
    "device_2": {"song_A": 2, "song_B": 4, "song_C": 1},
    "device_3": {"song_B": 6, "song_C": 1},
}
```

#### **Step 2: Secure Aggregation**

Each device generates random masks to hide their contributions. The server aggregates masked data and devices remove masks during decryption.

```python
import random

def secure_aggregation(devices):
    masks = {device: random.randint(-10, 10) for device in devices}
    masked_data = {device: {song: count + masks[device] for song, count in data.items()} for device, data in devices.items()}
    
    global_totals = {}
    for data in masked_data.values():
        for song, count in data.items():
            global_totals[song] = global_totals.get(song, 0) + count
    
    total_mask = sum(masks.values())
    return {song: count - total_mask for song, count in global_totals.items()}

final_results = secure_aggregation(devices)
print("Aggregated Results:", final_results)
```

#### **Step 3: Adding Differential Privacy**

To further protect user contributions, noise is added to the aggregated results:

```python
import numpy as np

def add_differential_privacy(global_totals, epsilon=1.0):
    return {song: count + np.random.laplace(0, 1/epsilon) for song, count in global_totals.items()}

dp_results = add_differential_privacy(final_results)
print("Differentially Private Results:", dp_results)
```

### **Part 2: Gboard Use Case – Federated Heavy Hitters Discovery**

#### **Objective:**

Identify new frequently typed words without exposing raw data.

```python
global_dictionary = {"hello", "world", "python"}

devices = {
    "device_1": ["hello", "federated", "analytics"],
    "device_2": ["world", "privacy", "learning"],
}

local_new_words = {device: [word for word in words if word not in global_dictionary] for device, words in devices.items()}
print("Local New Words:", local_new_words)
```

#### **Federated Training and Aggregation**

Each device trains a lightweight model on local data and sends encrypted updates to the server. The server aggregates updates and adds noise to ensure privacy.

## **Key Benefits**

1. **Enhanced Privacy**:  
    Local data never leaves the device; only encrypted or anonymized results are shared.
    
2. **Scalability**:  
    Distributed analysis reduces the need for central data collection and processing.
    
3. **Regulatory Compliance**:  
    By design, Federated Analytics adheres to privacy laws.
    
4. **User Trust**:  
    Applications leveraging Federated Analytics inspire confidence by prioritizing user data protection.
