# Day 11: Exploring PATE (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles)

Today, I began studying **PATE** (Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles), a technique that combines **Differential Privacy** and **Semi-Supervised Learning**. Building on the concepts of **privacy-preserving technologies** and **federated learning** explored in previous days, PATE provides a practical methodology for training machine learning models with sensitive data while ensuring privacy.

The study was based on the paper: ["Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05755). Here is the approach applied to a simulated dataset.

## **What is PATE?**

PATE enables secure knowledge transfer from multiple "teacher" models, each trained on private data fragments, to a "student" model. The key lies in **differentially private aggregation** of predictions from the teachers, allowing the generation of labels for the student model without exposing private data.

### **Key Components**
1. **Teacher Models**: Models independently trained on private data partitions.
2. **Differential Privacy**: Noise is added to the aggregation process to protect sensitive information.
3. **Student Model**: A model trained on unlabeled data that is labeled by the teacher ensemble.

## **Implementation**

### **1. Dataset Preparation**

A simulated dataset was created and split into partitions for the teachers.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate a simulated dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=10, n_informative=5, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split the dataset into partitions (one for each teacher)
num_teachers = 5
teacher_datasets = np.array_split(np.column_stack((X, y)), num_teachers)

# Display the dimensions of each partition
for i, dataset in enumerate(teacher_datasets):
    print(f"Teacher {i+1}: {dataset.shape}")
```

### **2. Teacher Models**

Each teacher model was trained independently on its data partition.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Train a model for each teacher
teacher_models = []
for i, dataset in enumerate(teacher_datasets):
    X_train, y_train = dataset[:, :-1], dataset[:, -1]
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    teacher_models.append(model)
    print(f"Teacher {i+1} trained.")
```

### **3. Private Aggregation**

The predictions from the teacher ensemble were aggregated with added noise to ensure differential privacy.

```python
from scipy.stats import mode

# Generate unlabeled data
X_unlabeled, _ = make_classification(n_samples=200, n_features=10, n_informative=5, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Add Laplacian noise for differential privacy
def noisy_aggregation(predictions, epsilon=1.0):
    counts = np.bincount(predictions)
    noise = np.random.laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1/epsilon, size=counts.shape)
    return np.argmax(counts + noise)

# Aggregate predictions from teachers
student_labels = []
for x in X_unlabeled:
    predictions = [model.predict(x.reshape(1, -1))[0] for model in teacher_models]
    aggregated_label = noisy_aggregation(predictions, epsilon=0.5)
    student_labels.append(aggregated_label)

print(f"Private labels generated for the student model: {student_labels[:10]}")
```

### **4. Student Model**

The student model was trained on unlabeled data labeled by the teacher ensemble.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Train the student model
student_model = LogisticRegression()
student_model.fit(X_unlabeled, student_labels)
print("Student model trained.")
```

## **Key Takeaways**

1. **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: PATE demonstrates how to train models securely using sensitive data without directly accessing it.
2. **Differential Privacy in Practice**: Adding noise to the aggregation process ensures compliance with privacy guarantees.
3. **Scalability**: This method can be scaled to larger datasets and used in real-world privacy-critical applications.
